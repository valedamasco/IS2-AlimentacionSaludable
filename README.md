# Hi! To non spanish readers
This was a project for a class, happy to share it, sorry to have it in spanish but you can take a look of the use of github. 

If you want to implement it try to use netbeans, I know, that's not okay. But, this class was about managing a project more that the good use of a language . The idea of this, was to give us an already system and we need to make changes "asked by the client". This system is not created by me, just added a few things
